# React Mesto Api Full

## About

Mesto - an interactive page where you can register users, add photos, delete them, and like them.

## Running
This project contain `frontend` and `backend` parts. You can run both use:

```
npm run start
```

## Frontend

The project is written in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JSX` using `React Fraemwork`. To building the SPA was used the `BEM` methodology. Data came from the backend and was sent to it through a class component using `RestAPI`.

## Backend

I used `Node.js` witch `Express Fraemwork` and `MongoDB` database to process and save data.

## Deploy

The project was build on the AWS cloud using `Nginx` and `PM2` to resume work in crash case.
